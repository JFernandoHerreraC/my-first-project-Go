# My first http server in Go

This my first http server created in the Go language

To be able to use it you need to have previously installed:

[1] the Goland programming language
[2] then git clone or download it.
[3] Open a console or terminal of your operating system and run the following script
    go build wiki.go
    go run wiki.go

That's all, for the realization of this example support me from the goland.com website, Thank you!
